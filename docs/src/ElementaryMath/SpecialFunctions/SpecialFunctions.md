    ðŸ”—[JuliaMath/SpecialFunctions.jl â€“ Special mathematical functions in Julia](https://github.com/JuliaMath/SpecialFunctions.jl)

    Special mathematical functions in Julia,
    include Bessel, Hankel, Airy, error, Dawson, exponential (or sine and cosine) integrals,
    eta, zeta, digamma, inverse digamma, trigamma, and polygamma functions.
    Most of these functions were formerly part of Base in early versions of Julia.

> Numerical routines for computing Bessel, Airy, and Hankel functions for real arguments.
> These routines are written in the Julia programming language and are self contained without any external dependencies.
